"""demo/serve.py: the client-facing surface. GIVEN.

    python3 demo/serve.py            # then open http://localhost:4390

Two panes. On the left, the chat a customer would see. On the right, the evidence
a sponsor would ask for: your bench numbers, your eval gates, your safety check.

Open this FIRST, before you change anything. On a fresh clone the agent behind it
does not answer yet, and the card that comes back instead is the first thing the
build asks you to read. Leave it running in its own terminal tab: every step ends
by sending the same message again and watching the answer change.

Why this is given rather than built: a terminal is not a demo, and writing a web
app is not what this half-day is about. The evidence is the work. Making the
surface yours is the stretch, not the task.

It calls YOUR run_agent(pnr, last_name, message). Nothing here knows or cares how
you implemented it, so it works with whatever you built.

Endpoints, all stdlib, no dependencies:

    POST /api/chat      {pnr, last_name, message} -> reply + this turn's trace
    GET  /api/evidence  reads .workshop/ and tells the panel what is true
    POST /api/confirm   {hold_id} -> the customer's own click, and a real token

That last one is the safety check, live in a browser. hold_seat is reversible so the
agent may call it. confirm_rebooking is not, so it needs a token only the
customer's click can produce, and this endpoint is that click. Try it with a
made-up token and watch it refuse.

NOTHING here ever answers with a traceback. A half-built agent is the normal
state of this repo for most of two sessions, so the three things that can go
wrong are told apart and each one comes back as a card the room can read:

    api       the Messages API refused the conversation your loop sent
    backend   the Larkspur mock said no (an expired hold, an unknown one)
    bug       something in this file broke, which is not a workshop step

Only the third one carries a traceback, and the page keeps it folded away.
