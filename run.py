"""run.py: drive your agent and watch what it does.

    python3 run.py K7PQ2M                # the plain tool loop (step 1.2)
    python3 run.py K7PQ2M --trace        # same, with the wire trace
    python3 run.py K7PQ2M --trace -v     # same, with the whole of every tool result
    python3 run.py --show-tools          # step 1.3: what Claude sees about your tools
    python3 run.py --tool-tax            # what those schemas cost on every turn
    python3 run.py --all --trace         # every Stage 1 ticket type (step 1.4)

--trace prints the wire: every API turn, the parameters you sent, the blocks
that came back, the tools Claude picked, what each tool answered, and what it
cost. Read it. The trace is the lesson. The answer is the by-product.

Tool results print under the call that asked for them, shortened to a headline.
-v prints the whole recorded result, which is what you want when a tool answered
with an error about its own arguments.

Every run also writes the trace to .workshop/last_trace.json, with or without
--trace, and under --all it is the LAST of the five that survives. That file is
what `python3 readout.py` turns into the team's one-page readout, so a run you
never made is a readout you cannot render.

--all also writes .workshop/last_run.json: one row per ticket type plus the
totals, because "it worked on K7PQ2M" and "it worked on all five" are different
claims and only the second one is worth putting on a readout.
